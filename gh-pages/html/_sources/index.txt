scikit-util : Sklearn meets H2O
===================================================================

Why?
====

What began as a succinct set of extension classes and utilities (as well as implementations of preprocessors from R
packages like `caret <https://github.com/topepo/caret>`_ ) grew to bridge functionality between sklearn and H2O.
Now, `scikit-util (skutil)` brings the best of both worlds to H2O and sklearn, delivering an easy transition into the
world of distributed computing that H2O offers, while providing the same, familiar interface that sklearn users have
come to know and love.
